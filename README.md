# SQL-MySQL--data-operation-playground

The focus of my academic project for course CSE Database System was to design and implement a comprehensive database system using MySQL. The project covered various aspects, including creating tables, loading data from CSV files, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and mastering the art of joins in SQL.


# Features:

- **Query Database:** Write and execute SQL queries directly through the application.

- **Visualize Data:** View and analyze data through built-in visualization tools.

- **Manage Tables:** Perform CRUD operations on tables with ease.

- **Database Insights:** Get insights into the structure and statistics of your MySQL database.
